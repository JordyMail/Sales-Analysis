# Sales Analysis & Forecast

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from 2020 to 2025, providing insights into trends, seasonality, and future sales predictions. The dataset includes:
- **Daily sales data** with seasonal variations and anomalies
- **Regional sales** (North, South, East, West)
- **Product categories** (Electronics, Clothing, Furniture, Groceries)

The project utilizes **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Statsmodels, and ARIMA forecasting** for comprehensive data analysis.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and ensures proper sorting
- **Moving Average Calculation**: Smooths out trends
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Identifies seasonal and trend components
- **ARIMA Forecasting**: Predicts sales for the next 30 days
- **Interactive Visualization**: Uses Plotly for better data exploration
